By installing this library you agree to be bound by the terms of the AI and Machine Learning License.

For this fork, you'll need Python 3.9 or newer.

Install the pypi package:

pip install --upgrade burnysc2
or directly from develop branch:

pip install poetry
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2/archive/develop.zip
Both commands will use the sc2 library folder, so you will not be able to have Dentosal's and this fork installed at the same time, unless you use virtual environments or poetry.
